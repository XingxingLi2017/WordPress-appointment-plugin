# WordPress-appointment-plugin
AppointmentPeach is a WordPress plugin that allows any site to host self-booked appointments by clients, patients or other customers.

Once the plugin is installed, the business administrator enters the names and roles of the providers, and the types of appointments and the roles of providers who can deliver those types of appointments, and the duration of each type of appointment.

When a customer books an appointment, they can start by selecting a type of appointment; they will then be able to choose a provider who can deliver this type of appointment.  Alternatively, they can select a provider by name; they will then be allowed to select a type of appointment that this provider delivers.

Once the appointment type and provider are selected, then the customer is presented a calendar of available times and dates, and selects one.  The customer then fills in identifying information, or can log in to have the information filled in.

When the customer clicks on Submit, their request for information is sent by email to the business administrator.  At the same time, the appointment time is marked tentatively reserved so that it can’t be requested by another customer,  When the business administrator finalizes the appointment, an email is sent to the customer confirming the appointment, and the appointment is marked “confirmed” in the database.

The customer has the ability to cancel an appointment at no charge until some set time (set by the administrator) before the appointment without charge, and after that with a charge.  A notice is provided on the appointment request screen and the change appointment screen of this deadline and the charge.
